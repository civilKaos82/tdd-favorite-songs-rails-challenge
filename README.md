# Test-driven Development: Favorite Songs

## Summary
This challenge assumes that we're—if not comfortable—at least familiar with testing a Rails application (see [rock-paper-scissors challenge][]).  In this challenge, we'll build a Rails application feature-by-feature, taking an [outside-in][thoughtbot outside-in testing] approach to testing:  for each new feature, we'll begin by writing a feature test which will lead us to write further tests as it drives our development (e.g., unit tests for our models).
